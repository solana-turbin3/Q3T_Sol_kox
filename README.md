Welcome to my PoW ! I'm a passionate developer focused on building and  contributing to the Solana ecosystem. Below, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked during last months related with Turbin3, with a focus on the Q3 Cohort.

I also included my participation in the Talent Olympics during the 4 days in which I earned a bronze medal.

Please, don't hesitate to drop some comments, open issues, follow or contribute.

<summary>Capstone</summary>

<br />

[comment]: <> (Describe)
### Introduction

My capstone project aims to create a platform that allows users to deploy customizable vaults on Solana. The platform is designed to start with simple vault structures that can be tailored to meet various needs and strategies.

### Goal

The primary objective is to offer a flexible platform for building and managing vaults, while also providing tools for options, analytics, and strategy development. 

The platform will integrate  Solana Blinks for facilitating the customer acquisition. 

### Technology Stack

* Blockchain: Solana
* Smart Contracts: Anchor
* Customer Acquisition: Solana Blinks
* Frontend: React
* Backend: Fastify

The roadmap is pretty extensive so I hope to keep it simple and see where it takes me.
